# rapidNotes
Online Notebook that uses JSON to store notes
## Overview
This is an online notebook made for daily notes storing. It uses `JSON` to store the notes, `php` to handle file insertions/deletions and `javascript` to render the notes and communicate to `php server`. I've also made a little `C++`part that analyses each note and returns the number of words and the longest one.
## Thanks
For this project to be possible, I used [falconmasters/darkmode-con-javascript](https://github.com/falconmasters/darkmode-con-javascript/) as a template and I modified it to fulfill my needings. Also I used [sweetalert2](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2) for the popups and messages.
